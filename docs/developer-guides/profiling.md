# Profiling

The profiling system tries to be contextual and _invisible_. Profiling data is sent as [gRPC Metadata](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/metadata/). To enable, set `Profiling.Enabled=true` in [configuration](../get-started/configuration.md).

Since each adapter to a request (see [architecture](architecture.md)) is a well-defined single-responsibility function, it makes sense to profile each of them. When enabled, the daemon will profile each adapter, and send back flattened data as a gRPC trailer. For readability's sake, this profiling is completely invisible and handled by the adapter logic in `pkg/types/adapter.go` (also see `pkg/types/timer.go`). This flattened data is parsed by the `cmd` package and displayed as shown below. An example out of `cedana dump containerd ...` when profiling is enabled:

Above, you can see complete flow of the request before it reaches CRIU's dump function, including _which_ plugin (2nd column) the adapter belongs to. For `containerd`, you can see that the request is largely handled by the low-level runtime `runc`'s plugin. The second table above shows a compressed view of the same data, with only the total time spent in each plugin/category. Note that, above there are some components that are executed concurrently, e.g. `rootfs`, so the time you see in the (flattened) data above is only the time spent _waiting_ for `rootfs` to finish.

In many cases, we may need to add more context to this data, or add more components to it. Helpers defined in `pkg/profiling/timing.go` can be used. A good example is adding a new component to the `compression` category in `internal/server/filesystem/dump_adapters.go` as seen above:
```
		_, end := profiling.StartTimingCategory(ctx, "compression", utils.Tar)
		tarball, err := utils.Tar(imagesDirectory, imagesDirectory, compression)
		end()
```

These helpers use the passed `context` to store profiling data. If the `context` already has parent profiling data, the data is added as a component to the parent.

Behind the scenes, if OTel is enabled ([configuration](../get-started/configuration.md) `Metrics.Otel=true`), this data is also captured in OTel spans.
