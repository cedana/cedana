## Authentication

Create an account at [auth.ui.cedana.com](https://auth.ui.cedana.com).

Once logged in, you'll be redirected to an account management page, where you can create an API key. If you've logged in via your organization's email address, you'll be able to create and manage organization-wide API keys as well.

Once you have obtained an API key, you must set it as the auth token in the [configuration](configuration.md). You must have received a unique URL for your organization; if not, use `https://sandbox.cedana.ai`.
