## Authentication

Create an account at [auth.cedana.com](https://auth.cedana.com).

Once logged in, you'll be redirected to an account management page, where you can create an API key. If you've logged in via your organization's email address; you'll be able to create and manage organization-wide API keys as well.

Once you have obtained an API key, you must set it as the auth token in the [configuration](configuration.md). You must have received a unique URL for your organization, if not, use `https://sandbox.cedana.ai`.
