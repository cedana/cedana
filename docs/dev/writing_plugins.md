## Writing plugins

Plugins are currently part of Cedana's source tree ([here](https://github.com/cedana/cedana/tree/d618239b6052cda14f2117123414f8054f2d47ba/plugins)) and are built and released together with the main Cedana binary. This guide will walk you through the process of writing a plugin for Cedana.

Check out the [feature matrix](../features.md) to see which features are currently supported by each plugin.
