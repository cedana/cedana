# Cedana

Build systems that bake real-time adaptiveness and elasticity using Cedana.

Cedana-client serves as client code to the larger Cedana system. We leverage CRIU to provide checkpoint and restore functionality for most linux processes (including docker containers).

We can monitor, migrate and automate checkpoints across a real-time network and compute configuration enabling ephemeral and hardware agnostic compute. See [our website](https://cedana.ai) for more information about our managed product.

Some problems Cedana can help solve include:

- Cold-starts for containers/processes
- Keeping a process running independent of hardware/network failure
- Managing multiprocess/multinode systems

You can get started using cedana today (outside of the base checkpoint/restore functionality) by trying out our [CLI tool](https://github.com/cedana/cedana-cli) that leverages this system to arbitrage compute across clouds.


## Build

Cedana needs `libgpgme`, `libbtrfs` and `libseccomp` on the machine to build against. On a debian based system, you can install them with: 

``` sh
apt install libgpgme-dev libseccomp-dev libbtrfs-dev
```

`

on centOS/RHEL: 

``` sh
yum install gpgme-devel libseccomp-devel btrfs-progs-devel 
```

`

To build: 

```go build```


## Usage

To use Cedana in a standalone context, you can directly checkpoint and restore processes with the cedana client. Configuration gets created at `~/.cedana/cedana_config.json` by calling `cedana bootstrap`. To use Cedana, you'll need to spin up the daemon, which is a simple gRPC daemon listening on 8080:

```sh
sudo cedana daemon start
```

All further commands interact with the daemon over RPC.


## Launching Work

Using cedana, you can checkpoint PIDs already running on the system, but may run into issues around process groups and/or file descriptors and network sockets. To bridge this gap and make the jobs more migratable, you can launch processes or work using `cedana exec`. For example:

```sh
cedana exec 'python3 example.py' example_job
```

where example_job is a job id associated with your task. To see tasks managed by `cedana`, you can use:

```sh
cedana ps
```

which also provides information about any local or remote checkpoints associated with the id. There's additional arguments you can pass to `exec` (such as passing a file for environment variables to launch the process with) which you can explore with `--help`.

### Checkpointing
To checkpoint a running job, you can run:

```sh
cedana dump job JOBID -d DIR
```
A successsful `dump` creates a `process_name_datetime.tar` file in the directory specified with `-d`. Alternatively, you can forego the flag by describing a folder to store the checkpoint in in the config:

```json
"shared_storage": {
    "dump_storage_dir": "/home/johnAdams/cedana_dumps/"
  }
```

See the configuration section for more toggles.

### Restoring

```sh
cedana restore job JOBID
```

Currently, we also support `runc` and by extension Docker, `containerd` checkpointing and more container runtime support planned in the future. It should be noted that container checkpointing is generally orchestrated externally, leading the CLI options to be a little janky.

Checkpointing these is as simple as prepending the `dump/restore` commands with the correct runtime. For example, to checkpoint a `containerd` container:

```sh
sudo cedana dump containerd -i test -p test
```

where `i` is the imageRef and `p` is the containerID.

For a Docker container (which generally wraps a runc runtime):

```sh
sudo cedana dump runc -i runcID -d DIRECTORY
```

where `runcID` is the ID of the runc container (separate from what Docker daemon uses) which you can grab from `runc ps`. To restore, you'll need the container bundle, which you can pass to restore with `--bundle`. You can make a copy from a running container using `docker export CONTAINER_ID -o container_bundle.tar` and then:

```sh
sudo cedana restore --bundle container_bundle.tar -i new_runc_id -d DIRECTORY
```
