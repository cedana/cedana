Welcome to Cedana! This repository is the home of the `cedana` daemon and the low-level orchestration of our save/migrate/resume (SMR) functionality, and is the entry-point into the larger cedana ecosystem.    

We build on top of and leverage [CRIU](https://github.com/checkpoint-restore/criu) to provide userspace checkpoint/restore of processes and the many different abstraction levels that lie above. We also provide the ability to checkpoint/restore rootfs in both containerd and CRIO interfaces for full container checkpoint/restores. 

For a list of supported runtimes, see our [container support matrix](docs/support/runtimes.md). 

We can monitor, migrate and automate checkpoints across a real-time network and compute configuration enabling ephemeral and hardware agnostic compute. See [our website](https://cedana.ai) for more information about our managed product.

Some problems Cedana can help solve include:

- Cold-starts for containers & processes
- Keeping a process or container running independent of hardware/network failure
- Managing multiprocess/multinode systems (independent of Kubernetes/SLURM or any orchestration)
- GPU checkpoint/restore 
- And more! 

## Build

Cedana needs `libgpgme`, `libbtrfs` and `libseccomp` on the machine to build against. On a debian based system, you can install them with: 

``` sh
apt install libgpgme-dev libseccomp-dev libbtrfs-dev
```

on centOS/RHEL: 

``` sh
yum install gpgme-devel libseccomp-devel btrfs-progs-devel 
```

To build: 

```go build```.
